Here are the instructions on what you have to do to install the Activity on Icy Phoenix.


* Upload all the files included in the package (you have both default and aphrodite, and even the Italian Lang if you need it)

* Go in ACP and install Activity in Plugins section, then reload ACP and configure Activity from its own section
